# SchedulingDemo
SQL, REST-api, .Net Core, ASP.Net, C# - Run with https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html

As this is a Demo, there are a few things that could be improved. Any code that needs improvement is described by comments in the given code. As for features, the main thing missing is a front-end GUI that would handle a lot of the input, as data is currently mainly being input FromBody. This would automate a lot of the input processes, and help with potentiel edge-case errors.

Other features that could spices up the solution could be something like specific shift types, that could only be assigned to Employees with the required qualifications. Then being able to sort based on this during the assignment would give a lot more flow to the user experience.

Automated testing is another thing i didn't have time for during this demo. In general i have a lot to learn regarding debugging these types of systems, as I'm used to being able to directly monitor the changes i make in something like Unity, as well as the consequences they have.
